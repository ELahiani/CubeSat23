woke up early by 6am
started working on the engineering notebook waiting for the other to wake up
got back to sleep by 7am
woke up again by 8am
had breakfast
finished by 9.40 and rested a bit while listening to some arabic music 
started first workshop by 10am: 3D WORKSHOP (Modelling and Renderring oriented)
- Understanding the 3 dimensions of space 
- Designing basic shapes 
- Join 2 objects together 
- Cut an object using a certain shape 
- Extrude, sketch, revolve, threading (inside: filtage/outside: tarrodage)
- Filet (smooth corners), Chamfer (break the selected edgr into 2 other edges)
- Shell (empties the inside of a shape)
- Change Parameters
- Split (seperate a plan from an object) =/= Combine
- pressing 'm' makes you able to move the object around
- Always devide the task and then join everything in one project
- Construct (virtual planes): offset planes
- Timeline: illustrates the design process step by step
- Joints: rotating, sliding, rigid body
- Component (free) vs Body (captive)
- add component and join them (press j)
- select a part of the corner of the first component and one part of the corner of the other componenet and then select motion
--> made a slidable window using the slide joint

types of assembling cubesats:
2 pieces of 3 faces cubesats
6 pieces of 1 face cubesats
3 pieces of 2 faces cubesats
4 pieces cubesats

ate lunch
started designing the cubesat
working on a video
logo design
engineering notebook progress
game break
went to the beach
came back, showered, ate dinner 
and went to sleep by 10/11pm
