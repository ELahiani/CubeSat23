introduction: what is a cubesat: nano satellites

what are they: 
small, low cost, space craft to revolutionize space exploration, couple of inches and less than 5 pounds
size and standars
accessibility
versatility
cost-effectiveness
expands opportunities, education, exploration...

are they important: 
1/ benefits 
affordable
rapid dev
educational opportunities
access to space
versibility and scalability
2/ limitations
size & payload (a module of sensors maybe)
the smaller the sat is the less its use will be
power & communication
short mission lifetime
limited orbital options
enviornmental hazards
3/ opportunities
educational programs, competitions (cubesat launch initiative), collaborations, stem clubs, online resources, outreach programs

use
earth observation
technology demonstration
communication
scientific research

successful cubesats
2012- QB50 (network of 50 cubesats)
2013- ArbuSpace (experiments in space)
2016- Grace-fo (earth's gravitation)
2017- IceCube (capture high-resolution images of the earth's poles)
2018- MarCO (communication relays for NASA)
2021- Team Tunisia's CubeSats

types
1U = the unite (10 cubic centimeters)
Pocket Qube (0.5U)
FemtoSats (less then 1U)
NanoSats (costumized qbsats)

Satellite remote sensing
concept dev (mission objectives and scope)
design and deg (detaled specification and selection of components)
assembly and integration 
testing and verification

what else?
launch and deployment
operation & data collection
duration & decommissioning (mission completion)

How they work 
What's it made of
power systems (batteries, solar pannels)
communication systems (ground station)
sontrol system (maintaining the orientation or attitude in space)
OnBoard computer (brain of the qbsat)
onboard:
--> control system: gyroscope, sensors
--> communication: sender and receiver

history
1990, standford uni, cubsat1 and quakesat
in 2006: first constillation of cubesats
2013: nasa's lauch opportunities

team divisions:
