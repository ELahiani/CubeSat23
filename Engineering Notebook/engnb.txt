1. Introduction:

What's a CubeSat?
A CubeSat, short for Cube Satellite, is a type of miniaturised satellite that is built using standard dimensions and components. CubeSats were first developed as an educational tool to provide students and researchers with a low-cost platform for space exploration and experimentation. However, they have gained popularity due to their small size, low cost, and ease of deployment.
CubeSats are typically cube-shaped and have standardised dimensions of 10 centimetres (about 4 inches) per side. They are often referred to by their "U" value, which represents the number of these 10 cm cubes they occupy. For example, a 1U CubeSat is a single cube, while a 3U CubeSat is three cubes stacked together.
These satellites are designed to perform a wide range of missions, including scientific research, technology demonstration, Earth observation, communication experiments, and more. While they are smaller and less capable than traditional satellites, CubeSats provide an accessible platform for many innovative ideas and experiments.
CubeSats are commonly launched as secondary payloads, hitching a ride on larger rockets that are primarily carrying larger satellites or payloads. This approach allows for cost-effective access to space for CubeSat developers. Once in orbit, CubeSats operate independently, performing their designated mission objectives.
Due to their small size and limited resources, CubeSats face several challenges, such as power constraints, limited communication capabilities, and shorter lifespans compared to larger satellites. However, advancements in technology continue to improve their capabilities, making CubeSats a valuable tool for various applications in space exploration and research.
   
Who Are We?
We, LabLabi Labs are a group of 5 teenaged tunisian high school students of ages ranging between 14 to 17. Our passion for space engineering and eagerness to improve our knowledge about it has brought us together to work on the Carthage-1 CubeSat mission.

Our CubeSat Mission
Our CubeSat is a 1U (10cm x 10cm x 10cm) cube-shaped Satellite. Its mission is to track and monitor various aspects of inner and outer space, which will be discussed in more depth throughout the Engineering Notebook.
The purpose of the Engineering Notebook of our CubeSat mission is to document the process of its creation following each step we made and give credit where it is due.

2. Mission Concept:
Our CubeSat will be deployed to monitor various aspects of inner space as its first mission and outer space as its second. 
The outer space mission (which will be primary) is mainly about the tracking of space debris which will help in improving space situational awareness and contribute to space debris mitigation efforts.
And the inner space mission (which will be secondary) will be about providing a study of the Earth's atmosphere by measuring parameters such as air composition, temperature, pressure, or pollution levels. This can contribute to climate research, weather forecasting, and environmental monitoring.
