A CubeSat, short for Cube Satellite, is a type of miniaturised satellite that is built using standard dimensions and components. CubeSats were first developed as an educational tool to provide students and researchers with a low-cost platform for space exploration and experimentation. However, they have gained popularity due to their small size, low cost, and ease of deployment.
CubeSats are typically cube-shaped and have standardised dimensions of 10 centimetres (about 4 inches) per side. They are often referred to by their "U" value, which represents the number of these 10 cm cubes they occupy. For example, a 1U CubeSat is a single cube, while a 3U CubeSat is three cubes stacked together.
These satellites are designed to perform a wide range of missions, including scientific research, technology demonstration, Earth observation, communication experiments, and more. While they are smaller and less capable than traditional satellites, CubeSats provide an accessible platform for many innovative ideas and experiments.
CubeSats are commonly launched as secondary payloads, hitching a ride on larger rockets that are primarily carrying larger satellites or payloads. This approach allows for cost-effective access to space for CubeSat developers. Once in orbit, CubeSats operate independently, performing their designated mission objectives.
Due to their small size and limited resources, CubeSats face several challenges, such as power constraints, limited communication capabilities, and shorter lifespans compared to larger satellites. However, advancements in technology continue to improve their capabilities, making CubeSats a valuable tool for various applications in space exploration and research.
